**IDEA:** QTT-Informed Subgraph Feature Engineering for Merger Tree Regression.

**Description:** Use Quantum Tensor Trains (QTT) to identify and extract salient subgraphs from merger trees. Instead of compressing the entire tree, QTT is applied to the *feature matrix* of small, localized subgraphs (e.g., k-hop neighborhoods around nodes). This generates compressed feature vectors representing the local environment of each node. These QTT-informed subgraph features are then used as input to a simpler regression model (e.g., a Random Forest or Gradient Boosting model) to predict halo properties like halo mass *at z=0*. This avoids the computational bottleneck of training a full GNN and focuses on extracting meaningful local information from the merger trees, making the problem computationally tractable with CPUs and a limited dataset. We circumvent the need for explicit formation history labels by focusing on predicting a final halo property directly. This approach leverages QTT for feature engineering rather than end-to-end compression, potentially offering a more efficient and interpretable solution.
