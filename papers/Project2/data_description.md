Generate your own data for studying neural network architectures for matter power spectrum emulators.
Constraints: 
- We are running only computational experiments in Python on a laptop. 
- The data should not take more than 3 minute to generate. 
- The research project should not be on the data generation itself, but on finding most efficient neural net architecture.
