Project Idea:
	* Mapping the Diversity of the Black Hole–Stellar Mass Relation Across Cosmological and Feedback Parameter Space
		- This project systematically quantifies how the slope, normalization, and scatter of the black hole–stellar mass relation in simulated galaxies depend on variations in cosmological and feedback parameters.
		- Leverages the dataset’s unprecedented parameter coverage to reveal the physical drivers of scaling relation diversity and secondary dependencies in galaxy evolution.
