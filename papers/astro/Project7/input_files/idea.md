**Idea:** Graph Spectral Analysis and Diffusion Geometry for Unveiling Cosmological Signatures in Merger Trees

**Description:** This idea leverages graph spectral analysis and diffusion geometry to extract robust, interpretable, and computationally efficient features from merger trees, enabling the discovery of relationships between merger tree morphology and cosmological parameters. Instead of TDA, we will focus on spectral properties of the graph Laplacian and diffusion maps, which are less computationally demanding.

1.  **Graph Spectral Feature Extraction:** Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian for each merger tree. Use the eigenvalues as features, capturing the overall connectivity and structure of the graph. Also, compute spectral moments, which summarize the eigenvalue distribution.

2.  **Diffusion Geometry Embedding:** Construct a diffusion map embedding of each merger tree. This involves defining a diffusion operator on the graph and computing its eigenvectors. The eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues provide a low-dimensional embedding of the nodes in the graph, capturing the diffusion geometry. Aggregate node embeddings at the graph level using mean/max/min pooling.

3.  **Astrophysically-Motivated Edge Feature Aggregation:** Calculate the mean and variance of edge attributes (scale factor difference, mass ratio) to capture merger event characteristics.

4.  **Dimensionality Reduction and Regression:** Apply PCA to the combined spectral features, diffusion map summaries, and edge statistics to reduce dimensionality. Train a regression model (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict cosmological parameters (Omega\_m and sigma\_8) from the resulting latent vectors.

5.  **Evaluation and Comparison:** Evaluate performance using R-squared, MSE, and uncertainty calibration metrics (expected calibration error, reliability diagrams). Compare against a baseline regression model trained on aggregated node features (mean/max/min pooling) and a graph neural network (GCN) baseline.
