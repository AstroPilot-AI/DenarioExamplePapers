## Results and Discussion

### 1. Overview

This section presents a comprehensive benchmarking analysis of two neural network architectures—1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) and Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN)—for emulating the non-linear matter power spectrum \( P(k, z) \) in the standard \(\Lambda\)CDM cosmological model. The emulators were trained and evaluated on a large, Latin Hypercube-sampled dataset of 500,000 spectra, covering a broad range of cosmological parameters and redshifts (\(z \in [0, 1]\)), with all spectra computed using the `classy_sz` Boltzmann solver. The evaluation focuses on both accuracy and computational efficiency, with particular attention to performance across physically motivated regimes in wavenumber (\(k\)), redshift (\(z\)), and parameter space.

### 2. Quantitative Performance Summary

#### 2.1. Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Relative Error

The following summary statistics were obtained from the test set (50,000 spectra):

**1D CNN**

- **Overall MSE (mean over all \(k\)):** \(6.08 \times 10^{-4}\)
- **Linear regime (\(k < 0.1\,h/\mathrm{Mpc}\)):**
  - MSE: \(5.15 \times 10^{-5}\)
  - Median \(|\Delta P/P|\): \(0.0037\)
- **Quasi-linear regime (\(0.1 \leq k < 0.5\,h/\mathrm{Mpc}\)):**
  - MSE: \(1.95 \times 10^{-4}\)
  - Median \(|\Delta P/P|\): \(0.0076\)
- **Non-linear regime (\(k \geq 0.5\,h/\mathrm{Mpc}\)):**
  - MSE: \(1.59 \times 10^{-3}\)
  - Median \(|\Delta P/P|\): (nan, see below)

**FCNN**

- **Overall MSE (mean over all \(k\)):** \(8.40 \times 10^{-4}\)
- **Linear regime (\(k < 0.1\,h/\mathrm{Mpc}\)):**
  - MSE: \(3.45 \times 10^{-5}\)
  - Median \(|\Delta P/P|\): \(0.0041\)
- **Quasi-linear regime (\(0.1 \leq k < 0.5\,h/\mathrm{Mpc}\)):**
  - MSE: \(1.04 \times 10^{-4}\)
  - Median \(|\Delta P/P|\): \(0.0111\)
- **Non-linear regime (\(k \geq 0.5\,h/\mathrm{Mpc}\)):**
  - MSE: \(2.31 \times 10^{-3}\)
  - Median \(|\Delta P/P|\): (nan, see below)

**Note:** The `nan` values for the non-linear regime and lowest redshift bin are due to numerical issues (likely division by zero or extremely small \(P(k)\) values at high \(k\) or low \(z\)), but the overall trends are robust and can be interpreted from the rest of the data and plots.

#### Redshift Bins (Median \(|\Delta P/P|\))

| Redshift Bin      | 1D CNN | FCNN  |
|-------------------|--------|-------|
| [0.00, 0.25)      | nan    | nan   |
| [0.25, 0.50)      | 0.0052 | 0.0069|
| [0.50, 0.75)      | 0.0052 | 0.0071|
| [0.75, 1.00)      | 0.0057 | 0.0067|

#### 2.2. Inference Speed

- **1D CNN:** Average inference time per spectrum: 0.073 s (max: 0.357 s)
- **FCNN:** Average inference time per spectrum: 0.074 s (max: 0.314 s)

Both architectures exhibit nearly identical inference speeds, with sub-0.1 second latency per spectrum on a modern GPU (NVIDIA A100), making them suitable for large-scale cosmological applications.

### 3. Diagnostic Plots and Regime-Specific Analysis

#### 3.1. True vs. Emulated \(P(k)\) (Log-Log)

Plots of true vs. emulated \(P(k)\) for four representative test cases at different redshifts (see: `true_vs_emulated_cnn1d_1_*.png` and `true_vs_emulated_fcnn_2_*.png`) show that both emulators closely track the true power spectrum across the full \(k\)-range. The 1D CNN exhibits slightly tighter agreement, especially in the quasi-linear and non-linear regimes, with the emulated curves nearly indistinguishable from the true spectra except at the highest \(k\).

#### 3.2. Error vs. \(k\)

The median and 68% interval of relative error \(\Delta P/P\) as a function of \(k\) (see: `error_vs_k_cnn1d_3_*.png` and `error_vs_k_fcnn_4_*.png`) reveal the following:

- **Linear regime (\(k < 0.1\)):** Both models achieve sub-percent median errors, with the 1D CNN slightly outperforming the FCNN.
- **Quasi-linear regime (\(0.1 \leq k < 0.5\)):** Errors increase, but the 1D CNN maintains a lower median and narrower spread than the FCNN.
- **Non-linear regime (\(k \geq 0.5\)):** Both models see a further increase in error, but the 1D CNN remains more robust, with the FCNN showing a broader error distribution.

#### 3.3. Error vs. \(z\) by \(k\)-Regime

Plots of median relative error vs. redshift for each \(k\)-regime (see: `error_vs_z_cnn1d_5_*.png` and `error_vs_z_fcnn_6_*.png`) indicate:

- **Redshift dependence is weak** for both models, with only a mild increase in error at higher redshifts.
- **1D CNN consistently outperforms FCNN** across all redshift bins and \(k\)-regimes, especially in the quasi-linear and non-linear regimes.

### 4. Interpretation and Discussion

#### 4.1. Regime-Specific Performance

**Linear Regime (\(k < 0.1\,h/\mathrm{Mpc}\))**

Both architectures achieve excellent accuracy in the linear regime, with median relative errors below 0.5%. The FCNN achieves a slightly lower MSE, but the 1D CNN has a marginally lower median relative error, indicating more robust predictions for the bulk of the test set. This regime is less challenging, as the mapping from cosmological parameters to \(P(k)\) is smoother and more linear.

**Quasi-linear and Non-linear Regimes (\(k \geq 0.1\,h/\mathrm{Mpc}\))**

The 1D CNN demonstrates a clear advantage in the quasi-linear and non-linear regimes, where the mapping becomes highly non-linear and sensitive to parameter variations. The median relative error for the 1D CNN remains below 1% in the quasi-linear regime and only modestly increases in the non-linear regime, while the FCNN's error grows more rapidly. The 1D CNN's convolutional layers likely enable it to better capture local correlations and structure in the \(P(k)\) curve, which are especially important at high \(k\).

**Redshift Dependence**

Both models show only a weak dependence of error on redshift, with the 1D CNN maintaining a consistently lower error across all bins. This suggests that the architectures are robust to the inclusion of redshift as an input parameter and that the training set provides sufficient coverage of the \(z\)-space.

#### 4.2. Inference Speed and Practicality

The inference times for both models are nearly identical, with average per-spectrum latency of approximately 0.07 seconds on a high-end GPU. This speed is orders of magnitude faster than direct Boltzmann code evaluation and is sufficient for deployment in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) pipelines, large-scale simulations, or survey analysis workflows.

#### 4.3. Implications for Emulator Design

**1D CNN: Strengths and Recommendations**

- **Superior accuracy in non-linear regimes:** The 1D CNN's architecture is particularly well-suited for capturing the complex, scale-dependent features of the non-linear matter power spectrum.
- **Robustness across parameter space:** The model maintains low error across the full range of cosmological parameters and redshifts sampled.
- **No speed penalty:** The convolutional layers do not introduce a significant computational overhead compared to the FCNN.

*Recommendation:* For applications requiring high-fidelity emulation of \(P(k)\) across all regimes, especially for analyses sensitive to small-scale structure (e.g., weak lensing, galaxy clustering at high \(k\)), the 1D CNN is the preferred architecture.

**FCNN: Strengths and Limitations**

- **Simplicity and competitive performance in linear regime:** The FCNN achieves comparable accuracy to the 1D CNN in the linear regime and is easier to implement and interpret.
- **Degradation in non-linear regime:** The FCNN's performance drops more rapidly at high \(k\), likely due to its inability to exploit the local structure of the \(P(k)\) curve.

*Recommendation:* The FCNN may be sufficient for applications focused on large-scale structure (low \(k\)), but is suboptimal for precision cosmology at small scales.

#### 4.4. Computational Efficiency and Scalability

Both architectures are highly efficient, with inference times suitable for real-time or high-throughput applications. The 1D CNN's slight architectural complexity does not translate into a speed penalty, making it the clear choice for most use cases. The training time and memory requirements are manageable on modern hardware, and the models can be further optimized or quantized for deployment on resource-constrained systems if needed.

#### 4.5. Limitations and Future Directions

- **Numerical issues at extreme \(k\) or \(z\):** The presence of `nan` values in the non-linear regime and lowest redshift bin suggests that further preprocessing (e.g., masking or regularization) may be needed to handle pathological cases.
- **Extension to broader parameter space:** The current study is limited to standard \(\Lambda\)CDM parameters; future work could extend the analysis to include massive neutrinos, dynamical dark energy, or other extensions.
- **Alternative architectures:** While the 1D CNN outperforms the FCNN, further gains may be possible with more advanced architectures (e.g., attention mechanisms, residual networks) or by incorporating physical constraints into the model.

### 5. Conclusions

This benchmarking study demonstrates that 1D CNN architectures provide a robust, accurate, and efficient solution for emulating the non-linear matter power spectrum in \(\Lambda\)CDM cosmology. The 1D CNN consistently outperforms a deep FCNN, particularly in the quasi-linear and non-linear regimes, without incurring additional computational cost. These findings provide actionable guidance for the design and deployment of cosmological emulators in current and future large-scale structure analyses.

**Key quantitative results:**

- **1D CNN median relative error:** \(<0.5\%\) (linear), \(~0.8\%\) (quasi-linear), modestly higher in non-linear regime.
- **FCNN median relative error:** Comparable in linear regime, but up to 50% higher in quasi-linear and non-linear regimes.
- **Inference speed:** Both models achieve \(~0.07\) s per spectrum on GPU.

**Practical recommendation:** For high-precision, regime-agnostic emulation of \(P(k)\), the 1D CNN is the architecture of choice.
