Project Idea:
	* Regime-Specific Performance of 1D CNN and FCNN Architectures for Non-linear Matter Power Spectrum Emulation in LCDM Cosmology
		- We present a comprehensive benchmarking study of 1D CNN and FCNN neural network emulators for the non-linear matter power spectrum in LCDM.
		- The study reveals how each architecture performs across physically motivated regimes in k, redshift, and cosmological parameter space.
		- Provides actionable guidance for efficient and accurate cosmological emulation by identifying where each architecture excels.
