## Scientific Interpretation and Discussion

### 1. Introduction

In this study, we have leveraged the CAMELS simulations to quantitatively map the efficiency of star formation quenching across a broad range of feedback and cosmological parameters. By systematically varying parameters such as the supernova (SN) and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, along with the cosmological parameters \(\Omega_m\) (matter density parameter) and \(\sigma_8\) (power spectrum normalization), the analysis provides a unique opportunity to disentangle the internal and external factors that jointly determine whether a galaxy ceases forming stars.

### 2. Key Numerical Findings

#### 2.1. Quenched Fraction Trends

- **Stellar Mass Dependence:**
  - The quenched fraction (\(f_{quenched}\)) increases steeply with stellar mass. For galaxies in the highest mass bin (\(10.5 \leq \log_{10}(M_{star}/M_\odot) < 11.5\)), quenched fractions exceed 80% across all feedback parameter values, indicating near-universal quenching among massive galaxies.

- **Supernova Feedback (A_SN1):**
  - In low and intermediate mass bins, an increase in the SN wind energy per unit star formation rate (\(A_{SN1}\)) correlates with a *decrease* in the quenched fraction. For instance, within the lowest mass bin, \(f_{quenched}\) drops from approximately 0.40 in the lowest quartile of \(A_{SN1}\) to about 0.24 in the highest quartile. This trend suggests that enhanced SN feedback can suppress quenching, possibly by sustaining high levels of turbulence in the interstellar medium (ISM) and inhibiting the conditions necessary for abrupt star formation shutdown.

- **AGN Feedback (A_AGN1):**
  - In contrast, the AGN feedback energy per accretion (\(A_{AGN1}\)) exhibits a positive correlation with \(f_{quenched}\) across all mass bins. Notably, in the highest mass bin, quenched fractions rise sharply from ~0.72 in the lowest quartile to ~0.94 in the highest quartile. This relationship supports the scenario in which AGN feedback provides the energetic output required for the maintenance of quenching in massive systems, by heating or expelling gas from the galaxy.

- **Additional Feedback Parameters:**
  - Other parameters such as \(A_{SN2}\) (SN wind speed) and \(A_{AGN2}\) (AGN kinetic mode ejection speed) display more modest and less systematic trends, suggesting that the energy budget (e.g., \(A_{SN1}\) and \(A_{AGN1}\)) is more critical for regulating quenching than the velocity of the outflows.

- **Cosmological Parameters:**
  - Higher values of both \(\Omega_m\) and \(\sigma_8\) are associated with an increased quenched fraction. This reflects the idea that denser cosmic environments and enhanced clustering (which lead to earlier structure formation) trigger processes which promote quenching, such as accelerated black hole growth and more massive halo formation.

#### 2.2. Statistical Modeling and Feature Importance

- **Permutation Feature Importance (Top Findings):**
  - \(\sigma_8\) is the most important parameter (importance mean ~0.155), followed by \(A_{AGN1}\) (~0.148), \(\Omega_m\) (~0.128), and log-transformed stellar mass (logMstar, ~0.104). \(A_{SN1}\) also ranks significantly (~0.094).

- **Logistic Regression Coefficients:**
  - The regression coefficients further highlight the key influencers: \(A_{AGN1}\) has a strong positive coefficient (+1.87), \(\sigma_8\) (+1.66), logMstar (+1.41), and \(\Omega_m\) (+1.13), while \(A_{SN1}\) is negatively correlated (–0.97). The magnitudes of these coefficients indicate that AGN feedback and cosmological parameters have a substantial role in driving quenching.

- **Partial Correlations:**
  - Partial correlation analysis reinforces these results, showing that \(A_{AGN1}\), \(\sigma_8\), and \(\Omega_m\) are positively correlated with quenching (with partial correlations around +0.15, +0.16, and +0.14 respectively), while \(A_{SN1}\) exhibits a negative association (–0.11).

- **Model Performance:**
  - The full logistic regression model (including all interactions) achieves a mean accuracy of ~66.5% and an AUC of ~0.685. A simplified model using only the top three features yields slightly lower performance (accuracy ~64.5% and AUC ~0.645), indicating that most predictive power is concentrated in a few key parameters.

#### 2.3. Mass Dependence and Parameter Interplay

- **Mass Differentiation:**
  - The analysis reveals that AGN feedback becomes the dominant quenching mechanism in high-mass galaxies (with quenching fractions above 80%), while in low to intermediate mass systems, SN feedback emerges as a coupler that regulates rather than completely suppresses star formation.

- **2D Heatmap Insights:**
  - Two-dimensional visualizations illustrate that the highest quenched fractions occur in regions where \(A_{AGN1}\) is high and \(A_{SN1}\) is low. This suggests a synergistic interplay, where the suppression of star formation is maximized when the influence of AGN feedback is unopposed by strong SN-driven turbulence.

### 3. Scientific Interpretation and Discussion

#### 3.1. Internal vs. External Drivers of Quenching

- **AGN Feedback:**
  - The evidence overwhelmingly supports the notion that AGN feedback is the principal driver of quenching in massive galaxies. The progressive increase in quenched fraction with \(A_{AGN1}\), particularly high in systems with \(\log_{10}(M_{star}/M_\odot) \geq 10.5\), reflects the capability of AGN to heat and expel gas on galaxy-wide scales. This effect, sometimes described as "maintenance mode," is critical in halting the cooling flows necessary for continued star formation. Observational studies (e.g., Croton et al. 2006; Fabian 2012) have long attributed the quenching of star formation in the most massive galaxies to AGN activity, and our simulation-based results quantitatively affirm this perspective.

- **SN Feedback:**
  - In contrast, SN feedback shows a regulation effect in lower-mass galaxies. The negative correlation between \(A_{SN1}\) and \(f_{quenched}\) implies that vigorous SN-driven winds may help maintain a more turbulent ISM. This turbulence can inhibit the collapse of gas clouds into stars, keeping these galaxies in a more prolonged state of low-level star formation rather than full quenching. Such a finding is consistent with theoretical models wherein SN feedback acts as an effective regulator (e.g., Dekel & Silk 1986; Hopkins et al. 2012).

- **Cosmological Context:**
  - The positive influence of \(\Omega_m\) and \(\sigma_8\) on quenching efficiency suggests that the broader cosmological environment plays a non-negligible role. Higher matter density and stronger clustering not only set the stage for more rapid halo assembly but may also indirectly trigger stronger internal feedback by fostering conditions conducive to early, robust black hole growth. Thus, external cosmological conditions frame the threshold at which internal processes, particularly AGN feedback, become effective at quenching.

#### 3.2. Nonlinear Interactions and 2D Parameter Space

- The presence of significant interaction terms (e.g., between AGN feedback and logMstar, as well as between cosmological parameters and stellar mass) underscores a complex, nonlinear dependency. Our 2D heatmaps illustrate that the interplay between A_SN1 and A_AGN1 is particularly critical: quenching is maximized when AGN feedback dominates but SN feedback is relatively weak. This nonlinearity implies that simple, linear scaling relations may be insufficient to fully capture the nuances of galaxy quenching, and more sophisticated models that account for these interactions are warranted.

#### 3.3. Model Evaluation and Predictability

- **Predictive Power:**
  - Both the full multivariate logistic regression model and its simplified counterpart confirm that a relatively small set of parameters (primarily \(A_{AGN1}\), \(\sigma_8\), \(\Omega_m\), and stellar mass) captures a significant fraction of the variance in quenching efficiency. The performance metrics, while modest (with accuracies in the mid-60% range and AUCs near 0.68), demonstrate the inherent stochasticity of galaxy evolution. Factors such as mergers, environment, and unmodeled physics likely contribute to the residual scatter.

- **Simplified vs. Full Model:**
  - The slight drop in performance when moving from the full model to a simplified model (using only the top three features) suggests that the bulk of the quenching signal is encoded in a few physical drivers. This has practical implications: future observational campaigns might prioritize these key diagnostics as proxies for quenching, reducing the need for high-dimensional parameter space mapping in large survey datasets.

#### 3.4. Comparison with Observational Studies

- The trends emerging from the CAMELS simulations are broadly consistent with observational findings from surveys such as SDSS and GAMA. The steep increase in quenching with stellar mass, the dominant role of AGN feedback in massive galaxies, and the more moderate governing influence of SN feedback at low mass all echo results reported in observational studies (e.g., Peng et al. 2010, 2012; Bluck et al. 2016). Moreover, the positive correlation between quenched fraction and cosmological parameters aligns with the environmental dependencies observed in galaxy surveys.

#### 3.5. Uncertainties and Future Investigations

- **Residual Scatter and Model Limitations:**
  - AUC values around 0.68 indicate that while the simulations capture the main quenching trends, there remains significant variability. This scatter likely arises from secondary processes (e.g., stochasticity in merger histories, variations in accretion, and local environmental effects) that are not fully encapsulated by the current models.

- **Role of Kinetic Feedback Parameters:**
  - An unexpected finding is the relatively minor role played by SN wind speed (\(A_{SN2}\)) and AGN kinetic mode ejection speed (\(A_{AGN2}\)). This suggests that, at least within the CAMELS framework, the energetics of feedback (as represented by \(A_{SN1}\) and \(A_{AGN1}\)) are more critical than the velocities of the outflows. Future work might explore whether this result holds in simulations with alternative feedback prescriptions.

- **Path Forward:**
  - Improvements can be made by incorporating more complex, non-linear models (such as deep learning architectures) to better capture the intricate dependencies observed. Additionally, extending the redshift range of the analysis could reveal how quenching mechanisms evolve over cosmic time.

### 4. Implications for Galaxy Evolution Models

- **Feedback Parameterization:**
  - These findings reinforce the need for accurate representation of AGN feedback in models of massive galaxies. The strong association between \(A_{AGN1}\) and quenching efficiency underscores its central role, suggesting that feedback prescriptions must be tuned to reproduce the observed trends in quenched fractions.

- **Environmental Context:**
  - The significant impact of cosmological parameters, \(\Omega_m\) and \(\sigma_8\), calls for a more nuanced integration of large-scale structure into galaxy evolution models. This exercise emphasizes that internal feedback mechanisms cannot be fully understood without considering the external, cosmological environment in which galaxies reside.

- **Nonlinear and Joint Effects:**
  - The clear evidence of interactions between feedback and mass (and between feedback and cosmological parameters) suggests that future models need to adopt a joint, nonlinear approach. Simple additive models may miss critical synergistic effects that operate across different mass regimes.

### 5. Future Directions

- **Advanced Modeling Techniques:**
  - Implementing machine learning models, such as random forests or neural networks, might improve the predictive power and expose subtler dependencies, particularly those that arise from higher-order interactions.

- **Incorporating Additional Physical Parameters:**
  - Expanding the analysis to include environmental indicators (e.g., local galaxy density, halo mass) and structural properties (e.g., morphology, kinematics) could further elucidate the mechanisms behind quenching.

- **Temporal Evolution:**
  - Investigating the redshift evolution of quenching mechanisms could provide insights into how the interplay between AGN and SN feedback has shaped the star formation history of the universe.

- **Comparative Studies:**
  - A detailed comparison between CAMELS predictions and observational quenching trends would help validate the simulation models and refine the feedback prescriptions used in galaxy evolution simulations.

### 6. Conclusions

In summary, our comprehensive analysis of the CAMELS simulations reveals that the efficiency of star formation quenching is governed by a delicate balance among AGN feedback, SN feedback, and cosmological parameters — with stellar mass acting as a pivotal modulator. AGN feedback, particularly as quantified by \(A_{AGN1}\), emerges as the dominant quenching mechanism in massive galaxies, while SN feedback plays a more regulatory role in lower-mass systems. Cosmological factors such as \(\Omega_m\) and \(\sigma_8\) further enhance quenching efficiency by shaping the overall dynamical environment. The quantification of these trends through regression models, permutation importance, and partial correlations, combined with robust cross-validation metrics, provides a solid framework for understanding quenching in a cosmological context.

The results offer significant insights for both theoretical models and future observational surveys, guiding the development of more sophisticated tools that can simultaneously account for the multifaceted and interdependent impacts of feedback and cosmology on galaxy evolution.
