### Methodology for Evaluating Neural Network Architectures for Matter Power Spectrum Emulation

#### 1. Data Preparation and Preprocessing

**a. Dataset Structure**  
Utilize the synthetic dataset comprising 4,000 samples, each with four cosmological parameters (Ωm, σ8, h, ns) and a 64-point matter power spectrum P(k) vector spanning 0.01–1.0 h/Mpc.

**b. Input Preprocessing**  
- Standardize each input parameter to zero mean and unit variance using statistics computed from the training set.
- No feature selection is performed; all four parameters are retained as inputs.

**c. Output Preprocessing**  
- Apply a logarithmic transformation to each P(k) value to stabilize variance across the k-range.
- Standardize the log-transformed P(k) values to zero mean and unit variance (per k-point) using training set statistics.

**d. Data Splitting**  
- Randomly split the dataset into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets, ensuring that augmented samples are distributed across all splits to maintain realistic variability in each subset.

#### 2. Model Architecture Selection

**a. Baseline Models**  
- Implement a fully connected (dense) neural network as a baseline, with several hidden layers and ReLU activations.

**b. Convolutional Architectures**  
- Design and implement 1D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with varying kernel sizes and depths.
- Develop dilated 1D CNNs, systematically varying dilation rates to capture multi-scale dependencies in P(k).
- Optionally, include residual connections or attention mechanisms to assess their impact on performance.

**c. Hyperparameter Grid**  
- For each architecture, define a grid of hyperparameters (number of layers, kernel size, dilation rate, number of filters, learning rate, batch size).
- Use the validation set for hyperparameter optimization.

#### 3. Model Training

**a. Training Procedure**  
- Use the Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate selected from the hyperparameter grid.
- Employ early stopping based on validation loss to prevent overfitting.
- Train each model for a maximum of 200 epochs, with batch normalization and dropout as regularization options.

**b. Loss Function**  
- Use mean squared error (MSE) on the standardized, log-transformed P(k) as the primary loss function.

#### 4. Model Evaluation

**a. Primary Metrics**  
- **Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE)** and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** on the test set, computed for each k-point and averaged over all k.
- **Maximum Percent Error** at each k-point to assess worst-case performance.
- **Computational Efficiency:** Record training time per epoch and inference time per sample for each architecture.

**b. Physics-Informed Metrics**  
- **Percent Error in P(k):**  
  \( \text{Percent Error}(k) = 100 \times \frac{|P_{\text{pred}}(k) - P_{\text{true}}(k)|}{P_{\text{true}}(k)} \)  
  Compute this for each k and report the mean, median, and 95th percentile across the test set.
- **Scale-Dependent Performance:**  
  Report metrics separately for large scales (k < 0.1 h/Mpc), intermediate (0.1 ≤ k < 0.3 h/Mpc), and small scales (k ≥ 0.3 h/Mpc).

**c. Model Comparison**  
- Tabulate and plot the performance of all architectures across the above metrics.
- Highlight the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.

#### 5. Justification of Methodological Choices

- **Multi-Scale Structure:**  
  The EDA revealed strong scale-dependent parameter influence and multi-scale structure in P(k), justifying the use of dilated CNNs to efficiently capture both local and global features.
- **Log-Transformation:**  
  The wide dynamic range of P(k) values motivates log-transformation to stabilize variance and improve regression accuracy.
- **Augmentation and Standardization:**  
  Data augmentation and standardization are retained to enhance generalization and ensure stable training.
- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  Percent error at different k-scales is critical for cosmological applications, as accuracy requirements vary by scale.

#### 6. Reporting and Visualization

- Present summary tables of model performance, including the following (example based on EDA results):

| Model Type      | Mean MAPE (%) | Max Error (%) | RMSE (log P(k)) | Train Time (s/epoch) | Inference Time (ms/sample) |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| Dense NN        | ...           | ...           | ...             | ...                  | ...                        |
| 1D CNN          | ...           | ...           | ...             | ...                  | ...                        |
| Dilated 1D CNN  | ...           | ...           | ...             | ...                  | ...                        |

- Plot percent error as a function of k for each architecture.
- Visualize example predictions versus true P(k) for randomly selected test samples.

#### 7. Reproducibility

- All preprocessing steps, model definitions, and evaluation scripts will be version-controlled and documented.
- Random seeds will be fixed for all data splits and model initializations to ensure reproducibility.
