**IDEA:** Predicting Halo Assembly Bias from Merger Tree Morphology using Graph Neural Networks and Topological Data Analysis.

**Description:** This paper explores the connection between a halo's merger tree morphology and its assembly bias. We hypothesize that topological features of the merger tree, such as the number of loops and branches, quantify the halo's formation history in a way that correlates with its large-scale clustering. We will train a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to predict a continuous assembly bias proxy from its merger tree, guided by insights from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). The GNN will take the merger tree as input (node features: normalized log mass, normalized log Vmax, scale factor; edge features: mass ratio of merging halos, normalized relative velocity difference, time difference between mergers) and output a prediction for the halo's assembly bias proxy. We will use persistent homology to extract topological features from the merger trees and inform the GNN architecture and training process.
