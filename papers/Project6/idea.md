Project Idea:
	* Mapping Star Formation Quenching Efficiency Across Feedback and Cosmological Parameter Space with CAMELS Simulations
		- This study systematically quantifies how the efficiency and prevalence of star formation quenching in galaxies at z=0 depend on supernova/AGN feedback and cosmological parameters.
		- Utilizes the CAMELS simulation suite to disentangle the physical drivers of quenching.
		- Provides predictive insights for galaxy evolution models and future observational surveys.
