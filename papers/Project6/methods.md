### Methodology for Quantifying Star Formation Quenching Efficiency Across Feedback and Cosmological Parameter Space

#### 1. Data Preparation and Integration

- **Data Loading:**  
  Load the full galaxy-level DataFrame (`galaxies_full_optimal.parquet`) and the catalog-level DataFrame (`catalog_params_optimal.parquet`) using efficient I/O operations (e.g., `pandas.read_parquet`).  
  Ensure all relevant columns are loaded, including SFR, M_star, catalog_number, and the six cosmological/feedback parameters.

- **Derived Quantities:**  
  Compute the specific star formation rate (sSFR = SFR / M_star) for each galaxy.  
  Add a boolean column indicating whether each galaxy is "quenched" (sSFR < 10⁻¹¹ yr⁻¹).

- **Data Integration:**  
  For each galaxy, ensure catalog-level parameters (A_SN1, A_SN2, A_AGN1, A_AGN2, Omega_m, sigma_8) are available.  
  If not already present, merge the catalog-level DataFrame onto the galaxy-level DataFrame using `catalog_number` as the key.

#### 2. Binning Strategy

- **Stellar Mass Binning:**  
  Bin galaxies by stellar mass using logarithmic bins, e.g., log(M_star/M_sun) = [8.5–9.5], [9.5–10.5], [10.5–11.5].  
  These bins are chosen to ensure sufficient statistics in each bin, as indicated by the EDA summary.

- **Parameter Binning:**  
  For each mass bin, further stratify galaxies by catalog-level parameters:
  - **Feedback parameters:** Bin each of A_SN1, A_SN2, A_AGN1, A_AGN2 into quantiles (e.g., quartiles or quintiles) to ensure uniform sampling across their broad ranges.
  - **Cosmological parameters:** Similarly, bin Omega_m and sigma_8 into quantiles.

- **Multi-dimensional Binning:**  
  For higher-order analysis, consider 2D bins (e.g., A_SN1 vs. A_AGN1) or use regression techniques to disentangle effects without excessive binning.

#### 3. Calculation of Quenching Metrics

- **Quenched Fraction:**  
  For each combination of stellar mass bin and parameter bin, calculate the quenched fraction:
  - f_quenched = N_quenched / N_total
  - Also compute the median sSFR in each bin for a continuous measure.

- **Uncertainty Estimation:**  
  Use bootstrap resampling within each bin to estimate uncertainties on f_quenched and median sSFR.  
  For each bin, resample galaxies with replacement (e.g., 1000 times), recalculate the metric, and use the standard deviation as the uncertainty.

#### 4. Statistical Modeling and Regression

- **Regression Analysis:**  
  To quantify the dependence of quenching efficiency on feedback and cosmological parameters, perform multivariate logistic regression:
  - Dependent variable: quenched status (binary)
  - Independent variables: A_SN1, A_SN2, A_AGN1, A_AGN2, Omega_m, sigma_8, and log(M_star)
  - Include interaction terms (e.g., A_SN1 × A_AGN1) to capture non-linear effects.

- **Partial Correlation Analysis:**  
  Compute partial correlations between each parameter and the quenched fraction, controlling for stellar mass and other parameters, to isolate direct effects.

- **Model Validation:**  
  Use k-fold cross-validation (e.g., k=5) to assess the robustness of regression results.  
  For each fold, fit the model on 80% of the data and test on the remaining 20%, recording performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC).

#### 5. Handling Computational Constraints

- **Efficient Data Processing:**  
  Use vectorized operations in pandas/numpy for all calculations.  
  For bootstrap and cross-validation, leverage parallel processing (e.g., Python’s `concurrent.futures` or `joblib`) to utilize all 8 CPUs.

- **Memory Management:**  
  Process data in chunks if necessary, especially for bootstrap resampling or when working with large intermediate tables.

- **Sampling for Exploratory Analysis:**  
  For initial exploratory plots or model prototyping, use stratified random subsamples (e.g., 10% of the data, preserving mass and parameter distributions) to ensure rapid iteration.

#### 6. Visualization Strategy

- **Quenched Fraction vs. Parameter Plots:**  
  For each stellar mass bin, plot f_quenched as a function of each feedback and cosmological parameter (e.g., line plots with error bars from bootstrap uncertainties).

- **2D Heatmaps:**  
  For pairs of parameters (e.g., A_SN1 vs. A_AGN1), create 2D heatmaps showing f_quenched or median sSFR, with color indicating the metric value.

- **Regression Coefficient Plots:**  
  Visualize the fitted coefficients from the logistic regression, with error bars from cross-validation, to highlight the relative importance of each parameter.

- **Summary Tables:**  
  Tabulate f_quenched and median sSFR for each mass and parameter bin, including uncertainties.

- **Interactive Plots (Optional):**  
  For in-depth exploration, consider generating interactive plots (e.g., using Plotly) to allow dynamic slicing by mass or parameter.

#### 7. Statistical Validation

- **Bootstrap Resampling:**  
  For all key metrics (f_quenched, regression coefficients), use bootstrap resampling to estimate uncertainties and confidence intervals.

- **Cross-Validation:**  
  For regression models, use k-fold cross-validation to ensure results are not driven by overfitting or sample variance.

- **Robustness Checks:**  
  Repeat key analyses with alternative binning schemes and sSFR thresholds to confirm the stability of results.

#### 8. Documentation and Reproducibility

- **Code Organization:**  
  Structure analysis scripts into modular functions for data loading, binning, metric calculation, regression, and visualization.

- **Parameter Logging:**  
  Record all bin edges, thresholds, and model parameters used in the analysis for full reproducibility.

- **Output Management:**  
  Save all intermediate and final results (tables, plots, model outputs) with clear filenames and metadata.
